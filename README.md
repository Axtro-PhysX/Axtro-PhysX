i specialize in security operations, engineering, and software development (mostly full-stack experience), but i'm always learning new things! 

# current interests

* getting paid to break things and calling it a career
* active directory pen-testing (it's a mess. every time.)
* the art of typing "sudo" before everything until it works
* metasploit modules made when i was 1 year old
* curl | bash and hoping for the best
