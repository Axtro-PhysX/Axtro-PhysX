He/Him

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Nisanth Nadimpalli and I'm a full-time student at the State University of New York at Albany. I'm seeking a full or part time internship position relating to the broad fields of Computer Science & Computing Security, whether that be software or security engineering, malware analysis, penetration testing, network engineering or even system administration. I love learning new things!

This page is used as a hub for both my school and personal projects (not all of which are public facing repositories.)
