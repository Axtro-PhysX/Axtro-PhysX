He/Him

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Nisanth Nadimpalli and I'm a full-time student at the University at Albany, a flagship school in New York's State University System. I'm seeking a full or part time internship position relating to the broad field of Computing Security, whether that be malware analysis, penetration testing, data governance, system administration, etc. 

I mostly work with Python and Java but I'm familiarizing myself with JavaScript, HTML, C/C++ along with Ruby and Go for future project/career usage. 

This page is used as a hub for both my school and personal projects (not all of which are public facing repositories.)
