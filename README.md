He/Him

Hi there! My name is Nisanth Nadimpalli and I'm a full-time student at the University at Albany, State University of New York. I'm seeking a full or part time internship position relating to the broad field of Computing Security, whether that be malware analysis, penetration testing, data governance, system administration, etc. 

I mostly code in Python and Java but I'm working on getting more familiar with JavaScript, HTML and C/C++.

This page is used as a hub for both my school and personal projects.
