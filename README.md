He/Him

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Nisanth Nadimpalli and I'm a full-time student at the University at Albany, a flagship school in New York's State University System. I'm seeking a full or part time internship position relating to the broad field of Computing Security, whether that be security engineering, malware analysis, penetration testing, network engineering & security or even system administration. I'm looking to gain experiance and determine what I want do in the wide world of tech.

I mostly work with Python and Java but I'm familiarizing myself with JavaScript, HTML/CSS, C/C++ along with Ruby, Go and Git for future project/career usage. 

This page is used as a hub for both my school and personal projects (not all of which are public facing repositories.)
